Dictionaries and tolerant retrival
============

Hashtables
------------
- Each vocalulary term is hashed to an integer.
- Procs : Lookup is faster than a tree => O(1)
- Cons : No easy way to find minor variants<br>
         No prefix search<br>
         if vocalbulary keeps growing, need to occasionally do the expensive operaiton of rehashing everything.<br>
         **Waste memory space**<br>
         **In the worst case, it performs terribly**<br>
         **Irregular search time**

Trees
------------
- Simplest Binary tree
- More usual : B+ tree
- Trees require a standard ordering of characters and hence strings ... but, we typically have one
- Pros : Solves the prefix problem (ex. terms starting with hany)
Optimized for disk-based retrieval
- Cons : Slower => O(logM) ( this requires balanced tree ) / Rebalancing binary trees is expensive


B+ tree
============
- Indexing mechanisms used to speed up access to desired data.
- **Search Key** : attribute to set of attributes used to look up records in a file
- **Index file** : consists of records ( called index entries ) of them
- TWO basic kind of indices :
1. **Ordered Indices** : search keys are stored in sorted order
2. **Hash indices** : search keys are distributed uniformly across "bucket" using a "hash function"

Index Evaluataion Metrics
------------
- Access types supported efficiently
- Access time
- Insertion time
- Deletion time
- Space overhead

Ordered Indics
------------
- In an **Ordered Index**, Index entries are stored sorted on the search key value
- **Primary Index** (**Clustering index**): in sequentially ordered fiel, this index whose search key specifies the sequential order of the file.
- **Secondary Index** ("non-clustering index"): ans index whose search by key specfiies an order diffent from the sequential of the file.


Dense_Index_Files
-------------
Dens-Index - Index record appears for every search-key value in the file.
<br>

- Dense index on dept_name, with instructor file sorted on dept_name

Sparse_Index_Files
------------
- contatins index records for only some search-key values
- To locate a record with search key value k we<br>
  Find index record with search-key value K we<br>
  Search file sequentially starting at the reocord to which the index record points

Secondary Indics
------------
- Indexed record points to a buket that contains pointer<br>
  to all the actual records with that particular search-key value
- Secondary indics hav to be dense

Primary and Secondary Indics
------------
- Indices offer substantial benefits when searching for records
- BUT: Updating indices imposes **overhead** on database modification when a file is modifided, every index on the file must be updated.
- Sequential scan using primary index is efficient, but **a sequential scan using a secondary index is expensive**

Multilevel Index
------------
- If primary index does not fit in memory, access becomes expensive
- Solution: treat primary index kept on disk as a sequential file and construct a sparse index on it.
- outer index – a sparse index of primary index
- inner index – the primary index file
- If even outer index is too large to fit in main memory, yet another level of index can be created, and so on
- Indices at all levels must be updated on insertion or deletion from the file.

B+-Tree Index Files
============

B+-tree is a rooted tree satisfying the following properties:
------------
- All paths from root to leaf are of the same length (balanced)<br>
==> Complete Binary Rebalanceing Tree
- **Each node that is not a root or a leaf has between [n/2] and n children**
- **A leaf node has between [(n−1)/2] and n–1 values**
- Special cases: <br>
    1.If the root is not a leaf, it has at least 2 children.<br>
    2.If the root is a leaf (that is, there are no other nodes in the tree), it can have between 0 and (n–1) values.<br>
    Disk-base data structure (not main memory)<br>
        - Page<br>
    Fanout n of a node: the number of pointers out of the node<br>
