Object-Oriented Software Development Process
=============

3 Points of successful software
-------------
#### 1. A successful software product must satisfy the stakeholder's **Requirements**.
#### 2. A successful software product must be developed **on time** and **on budget**.
#### 3. A successful software product must be resilient to **change**.

Why do we need software engineering?
-------------
#### 1. Increasing Size of Software product.
#### 2. Increasing Complexity of Software product.


### A development process defines **WHO** is doing **WHAT**, **WHEN** and **HOW** to reach a certain goal.

Basic workflows (or disciplines) in a process
--------------
#### 1. Analysis
#### 2. Design
#### 3. Implementation
#### 4. Testing -> (test code is very important!)

Problems in Conventional Software Development
--------------
#### 1. Long delays
#### 2. High development cost
#### 3. High cancellation rate
#### 4. Low quality
#### 5. High maintenance cost

WaterFall Model Problems
--------------
#### 1. Requirements can't be Fairly Accurate.
#### 2. Requirements aren't Stable.
#### 3. Design can't be Done, before Programming.
