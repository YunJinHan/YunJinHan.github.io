Iterative Development
=============
Waterfall model iterative -> spiral model

Chararter
-------------

1. Small steps, feedback and refinement and adaption

2. **Iterative & incremental**

3. Time-boxed ( Prepare fixed deadline )

-> iterative development : each function is done step by step

-> hard or unknown function is early done then easy function

Benefits
-------------

1. Early mitigation of high risks

2. Early visible progress

3. Early feedback, user

4. **Managed complexity**

5. Can improve the process itself, iteration by iteration

A Popular Iterative Process - The Unified Process
-------------

Procedure
1. inception 
2. ealboration
3. construction
4. transaction
-> each step has done all job but more important job than other
